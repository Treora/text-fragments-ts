# Text Fragments — TypeScript implementation

This is an implementation of (most of) the [WICG’s Text Fragments draft specification: <https://wicg.github.io/scroll-to-text-fragment/>][spec].

It implements the spec line by line, in order to help serve as a reference implementation and to help test the specification. No attempt is made to e.g. increase efficiency.

A polyfill is provided to use text fragments in browsers and other HTML viewers that do not support this feature natively.

Try it out in the [playground][]!
